                Be sure to check the water temperature in your tank every day.
                <b>Weekly:</b>
                replace 10% of the tank with clean water
                test the pH, ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, hardness, alkalinity and chlorine
                clean away any algae.<br>
                <b>Monthly:</b>
                vacuum aquarium gravel
                replace 25% of the tank with clean water
                inspect filter; rinse or replace the cartridge, carbon and pre-filter if necessary
                clean away any algae
                remove and clean plastic plants and decorative items
                replace air stone
                prune live plants if necessary</p>

	          		<h2>How to set up tank</h2>
	           		<p>Thoroughly wash aquarium gravel, rocks and ornaments with warm water, then add them to your tank.
                Do not use soap or detergents—they are highly toxic to fish.
                To wash the gravel, put it in a colander over a plastic pan or bucket and add water. Stir the gravel, drain, and repeat until the water stays clear and is free of debris.<br>
                Fill your tank approximately one-third full with room temperature water from a clean bucket.
                Pouring the water onto a plate or saucer sitting on the gravel will help keep the gravel in place.
                Add a water conditioner, like Tetra® AquaSafe® Solution, to de-chlorinate the water. Chlorine is fine for you, not your fish!
                Connect the airline tubing from the air pump to any air outlets inside your tank, such as air stones or decorations.
                By using an aquarium check valve, you can safely locate your air pump underneath your aquarium. (A check value is a small valve that is placed in the air tubing outside of your tank. It acts as a stop, preventing water from backing up and out of your aquarium if the power is turned off.)
                Aquascape with live and/or plastic plants.
                Ideally, these should be arranged to hide your equipment.
                If you’re adding live plants, make sure the water is warm enough for them. Plant the roots gently below the surface of the gravel, leaving the crown (if the plant has one) exposed.
                Remember to keep live plants moist until they’re planted—wet newspaper works well. For optimum growth and root development, use an aquatic plant fertilizer such as Tetra® FloraPride® and the proper lighting.
                Add the rest of the water.
                Fill your tank to the bottom of the top frame —leaving some air space between the water and the cover.
                Set up your filter and “cycle” your new tank. If you are using…
                …any outside filters:
                <br>
                Fill them with filter materials or filter cartridge.
                Position them according to instructions.
                Make sure it is primed (filled) with water.
                …”hang on tank” filter that has a pickup tube:
                <br>
                Extend the tube as close to the bottom of the tank without being in the gravel. If it is too long, you can cut it to length and reattach the intake cage.
                Be sure to open the filter lid and fill the filter with water to “prime” the pump.
                Important: “Cycling” your tank means growing the correct, healthy bacteria on a new filtration system to remove dangerous toxins. Add Tetra® AquaSafe® Solution, and you can quickly cycle your tank and add fish right away.
                Secure the submersible heater near your water flow and place the thermometer as far away from the heater as possible.
                Make sure you have a thermometer that’s easy to read. Most retailers sell an adhesive thermometer that adheres to the outside surface of the glass. Plug it in only after it is in the water.
                Plug in your air pump, power filter and heater and start them up.
                Important: Do not switch on the heater when it’s not immersed in water—the heating element can malfunction and overheat, and the glass tube can shatter if placed in water while hot.
                Check the air outlets and adjust the settings.
                Make sure water is flowing properly through your power filter.
                Adjust the heater to the proper temperature. It will take 24 hours for the temp to stabilize and you may have to adjust your setting.
                Wait 24 hours to ensure all equipment is working properly before adding fish.<br>
                Check the conditions and temperature after a few hours.
                Water in new aquariums will often turn cloudy for a day or two. This is caused by a harmless bacterial growth and should disappear naturally. </p>
