<h1>UAE Animal Welfare</h1>
  <h2>Dubai dog shelter braced for rush of unwanted Christmas puppies</h2>
      <h4>The emirate’s oldest dog rescue centre is preparing for its annual rush, as the novelty of puppies bought as Christmas gifts begins to wear off and owners realise the work, training and love needed to keep a pet.

Each year hundreds of dogs are abandoned in the emirate, with staff at K9 Friends Dubai taking calls daily to look after dogs left by owners who leave the country or will not commit to the effort the pets need.


The centre, which has been running for 28 years and is close to finding a new home for its 5,000th dog, is housing about 140 dogs, 20 above its capacity.

"We’re always full," manager Alister Milne said. "There are all sorts of reasons so nothing shocks me any more."

  <h2>How we treat animals reflects our society</h2>
      <h4>Last month, many of us were shocked by a viral video of an Emirati teenager throwing a cat against a wall before leaving it to die. Sadly, the perpetrator didn't face any legal consequences. The act was disturbing not only because of its brutality, but also because it contravenes the teachings of Islam and the norms and values that we are taught.

As a society, we need to ask ourselves some tough questions. First, are we doing enough to ensure that our children respect living beings? Are we teaching them empathy? It’s parents and teachers who can instil such fundamental values in a child. </h4>

  <h2>Animal abusers in UAE should face full brunt of law, advocates urge</h2>
    <h4>People who abuse animals should be jailed and the public made more aware of why people should be kinder to pets and strays, animal welfare groups say.

After several high-profile incidents this year, Fatima Al Zaabi, co-founder of Protection of Animal Rights Association in Dubai, said more education and tougher enforcement of laws would help to ensure there is no repeat of cruelty cases next year.


"We need imprisonment," said the Emirati. "They need to pay for what they have done because those who harm an animal can harm a human. The law really needs to be applied and create a community service programme for abusers to understand why they should not do that."

Earlier this year, President Sheikh Khalifa issued Federal Law No 18 for 2016 to tackle cases of animal cruelty. Anyone in violation faces a one-year jail term and/or a fine not exceeding Dh200,000.
